## RQ
- A general survey of how github is actually being used for collaborative coding
- How are git and github actually being leveraged? just as a host, or as a collaborative tool?
- How does this relate to the nature of archaeological research and collaboration?

## Approach
- Similar to Sophie and Ben's paper on 'tool driven revolutions', which highlighted a trend and commented on its implications

Some patterns to examine:
- How many people are contributing to each repo, and in what capacity?
  - Network analysis might be helpful here
- The spacing of contributions over time
  - Is actual collaboration becoming more common, even if it's still rare?
- How is support being requested and/or provided?
  - Proviso that GH issues aren't really intended for support questions
- How is code being reused, forked or referenced?

## Sampling
- Currently 210 out of 270 records have a github repo
  - We should do a search for more records before analysis (e.g. look through repos and stars of people already in the dataset)
- More comprehensive analysis on a subset that make greater use of github's collaborative features
- Do we want to include other platforms?
  - Shouldn't be too hard to include GitLab at least, if enough use it to make it worth it?
- Are we including things that are not software, i.e. lists, guides, datasets, etc?
- Potential blind spots include:
  - ancient dna
  - palaeoclimate reconstruction
  - instrumental analysis
  - tools developed for fields that may or may not involve archaeologists' input or archaeological use cases
- Blank repos currently not included
- Refer to Clemens' 'following' list for a comprehensive list of github users who refer to themselves as archaeologists
  - To compare how many of the total are active
- How do we deal with accounts created by institutions or collectives?
  - Theoretically these should still be associated with one or more personal accounts <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts>

## Tags
- Used to describe the repo, its purpose as defined by the authors, basically how the items are indexed on the website
- Useful bins for statistical analysis
- Brief description or explanation of scope may be necessary for each tag
- Relatively flat, not taxonomic
- Tagging must essentially be done from scratch, I'm not really satisfied with the tags used, their lack of description, and the spotty coverage throughout the dataset

## Qualitative coding
- Codes will include terms representing user behaviour, use of features, forms of communication, kinds of statements made by users, ...
- Taxonomic code system following an open-ended preformed structure (just stubs), with open coding to identify and situate actual codes within the structure
- The 'texts' to be coded will include issues, commit messages and pull requests. Maybe also readme files and comments within code, though we will have to determine the circumstances under which we delve into these materials
